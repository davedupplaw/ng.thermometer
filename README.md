# Angular Thermometer Component

(Early Progress)

This is a port of the [jQuery Thermometer Component](https://github.com/davedupplaw/jquery.thermometer)
I wrote a few years ago to an Angular component.

This is still in early progress and doesn't yet support everything from the jQuery
component. It's also a bit glitchy here and there.

It's not yet published to NPM.

To run the test app:

```
ng build --project=ng-thermometer
ng server
```

No license until I'm nearer finished, but will likely by MIT.
